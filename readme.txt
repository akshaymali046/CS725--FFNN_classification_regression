## Description

In this assignment, we explore the implementation of Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) to solve classification and regression problems. The primary goal is to apply the concepts learned in the CS 725 course to practical machine-learning tasks.

## Features

- Implementation of a multi-layer FFNN architecture.
- Support for both classification and regression tasks.
- Training and validation of the FFNN model.
- Evaluation of model performance using relevant metrics.
